Various non-VCV instruments

## Native Instruments Reaktor 6 required (untested in Reaktor Player)
Everything I've uploaded so far have been `.ens` Ensemble configs (full mostly of .mdl Macro units) for Native Instruments Reaktor.

### Ensembles

- *Alien Emulation* is a kind of 3D Theremin, with a typical volume antenna, two pitch antennas and a filter falloff control, but it doesn't quite sound like one. Doesn't actually use beating mistuned sub-MHz radio waves to make the tones, for a start, nor does it makes any attempt to fake it.
- *Additive Plucker* is inspired by a DIY sound card for the BBC Micro. The plans for the original were published (as I recall) in the official BBC Micro magazine, along with the driver and control software. This one's a bit more sophisticated than the one they suggested, but the idea's the same: Most real world instruments, especially plucked strings 
- *Beeb* is instpired by the amazing software-based enhancements made by the BBC Micro in controlling its otherwise fairly simple 3 square, 1 noise oscillator chip.
- *Phonystyle* is inspired by the excellent Dubreq Stylophone Gen-X1. Buy one of those instead of downloading this.
- *Phonystyle Plus* is the basic schematic from the Phonystyle, with some enhancements borrowed from Alien Emulation

### Instruments
I plan to upgrade all my Ensembles to proper Intruments, and to do whatever is needed to make them availalbe on the NI community store.

### Blocks
I plan to upgrade all my Macros to proper Blocks, and to do whatever is needed to make them availalbe on the NI community store.
