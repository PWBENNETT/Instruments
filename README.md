# Instruments
Various non-VCV instruments

## Native Instruments Reaktor 6 required (untested in Reaktor Player)
Everything I've uploaded so far have been `.ens` Ensemble configs (full mostly of .mdl Macro units) for Native Instruments Reaktor.

### Ensembles

- *Alien Emulation*
  Something like a Theremin for space aliens, I suppose.
  
- *More Here ...*
  Need to lost the other Ensembles I've uploaded. Either way, more docs are needed per Ensemble.

### Instruments
I plan to upgrade all my Ensembles to proper Intruments, and to do whatever is needed to make them availalbe on the NI community store.

### Blocks
I plan to upgrade all my Macros to proper Blocks, and to do whatever is needed to make them availalbe on the NI community store.
